# My Own Spotify Wrapped

I decided to run a test on my data wrangling and visualization skills and try to replicate the most important insights from the annual Spotify Wrapped, using my own streaming history downloaded from Spotify. Visualizations for most played songs and artists were created using Pandas, apart from a dataframe containing the country of origin of each artist and the amount of playback time from each country. Finally, a Folium Choropleth map was created, highliting the countries with the most playtime. 

More details in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/bryanjva/MyOwnSpotifyWrapped/blob/main/Wrapped%202024.ipynb) for the project.
